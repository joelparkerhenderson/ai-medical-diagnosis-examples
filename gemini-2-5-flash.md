# AI medical diagnosis examples: Google Gemini

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real hospital.

This page shows an AI medical diagnosis example that uses OpenAI ChatGPT 5.

## Input

```text
This symptom list is in my own words.

Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in because I had the wind knocked out of me. 
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife in casual conversation.
```

## Output

**I cannot give medical advice.** The symptoms you've described, especially the difficulty breathing, "near-instant throat closing," and mental confusion, are very serious. These could be signs of a severe allergic reaction or other life-threatening condition.

**You need to get immediate medical attention.** Please call an emergency number like 911 (in the U.S. and Canada) or go to the nearest emergency room right away. Do not wait for your symptoms to get worse.
