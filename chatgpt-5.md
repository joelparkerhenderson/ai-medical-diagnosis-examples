To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real hospital.

This page shows an AI medical diagnosis example that uses OpenAI ChatGPT 5.

## Input

```text
This symptom list is in my own words.

Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in because I had the wind knocked out of me. 
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife in casual conversation.

## Output

Your description points to a **serious respiratory illness** with possible airway involvement, and the changes you’ve noticed — especially the *throat closing sensation*, *stridor*, *shortness of breath*, and *mental confusion* — are red-flag signs that may indicate a medical emergency.

Here’s a structured breakdown of what stands out in your symptoms:

---

### 1. **Respiratory & Airway Concerns**

* **Shortness of breath** (hard to breathe in and deep) for 5 days.
* **Stridor**, **wheezing**, and **whistling breath** → suggest partial airway narrowing or swelling.
* **Near-instant throat closing** today → possible laryngeal spasm, airway edema, or severe allergic/inflammatory reaction.
* Episode yesterday of *“couldn’t breathe in because the wind was knocked out”* → could be sudden airway obstruction or spasm.
* Persistent, frequent cough.

---

### 2. **Systemic Infection Signs**

* Fever, soaking sweats, chills → typical of significant infection.
* Nasal discharge starting gold-colored → could indicate bacterial component, but color alone doesn’t prove it.

---

### 3. **Unusual/Severe Features**

* **Mental confusion for 15 minutes** → possible low oxygen levels, high fever effects, or systemic inflammatory response.
* **Spasms / internal contractions** → could be related to severe coughing, low oxygen, or a systemic reaction.
* **Total loss of appetite** → common in severe illness, but notable if combined with the above.

---

### 4. **Potentially Concerning Causes**

While only a clinician with an in-person exam and possibly tests (oxygen saturation, chest X-ray, throat inspection, labs) can diagnose, possibilities that should be urgently excluded include:

* **Severe respiratory infection** (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis with airway swelling, epiglottitis, influenza, RSV, COVID, pertussis).
* **Upper airway swelling** (allergic reaction, severe inflammation, laryngitis, epiglottitis).
* **Asthma flare or reactive airway response** secondary to infection.
* **Sepsis** (infection causing systemic inflammation) given fever + confusion + systemic symptoms.

---

### 5. **Why This is Urgent**

* **Airway risk:** Stridor + throat closing sensation = possible *rapid airway compromise*.
* **Confusion:** May mean low oxygen or poor blood flow to the brain.
* **Breathing difficulty worsening over days:** Risk of respiratory failure.

---

**⚠️ Strong recommendation:**
You should **seek emergency care immediately** (ER / urgent care with ability to handle airway emergencies).
While you might feel okay between episodes, airway obstruction and severe infection can deteriorate very quickly — sometimes in minutes.

Bring this symptom list with you so medical staff can see the progression clearly.

---

If you’d like, I can organise your symptoms into a **timeline and concise clinical summary** that you can hand directly to ER staff so they immediately understand the progression and severity. That can speed up your care.
Would you like me to do that now?

Here’s a **clear, medically-focused summary** you can give directly to ER staff.
It’s structured for quick scanning so they can immediately see the progression and red flags.

## **Patient Symptom Timeline & Summary**

**Duration:** Sick for 6 days. Symptoms have significantly changed over time.

---

### **Day 1–2**

* Gold-colored nasal mucus.
* Runny nose → nasal congestion.
* Fever, chills, soaking sweats.

---

### **Day 3–4**

* Postnasal drip, blowing nose every few minutes.
* Shortness of breath begins — difficulty breathing in and taking deep breaths.
* Persistent, semi-productive cough every few minutes.
* Wheezing and whistling breath noted.

---

### **Day 5**

* **Burning sensation** in upper throat and back of mouth.
* **Episode:** sudden inability to breathe in, sensation like *“wind knocked out”*.
* Stridor noted intermittently.

---

### **Day 6 (Today)**

* **Near-instant throat closing** episode.
* Shortness of breath continues.
* Persistent cough.
* Total loss of appetite.
* Spasms/internal contractions (“imploding” feeling).
* **15-minute episode of mental confusion** — unable to understand spouse in casual conversation.

---

## **Key Red-Flag Symptoms**

* Progressive **shortness of breath** (5 days).
* **Stridor** and **near-complete throat closing** episode today.
* **Transient confusion**.
* Fever, chills, sweats.
* Severe, persistent cough.

---

## **Possible Urgent Concerns**

* Acute upper airway swelling (e.g., epiglottitis, severe laryngitis, allergic/inflammatory reaction).
* Severe respiratory infection (e.g., pneumonia, influenza, COVID, pertussis).
* Risk of airway obstruction and/or respiratory failure.
* Possible sepsis (infection + confusion).

---

**⚠️ Emergency Priority:**
Airway compromise risk + altered mental status = **emergency evaluation needed now**.

---

If you print or show this on your phone at triage, it will save you time explaining and ensure they know what’s urgent.

---

Do you want me to also prepare a **short 2–3 sentence triage statement** you can read to the nurse so they prioritise you immediately? That way you don’t have to explain everything under stress.

Here’s your **one-page emergency handover sheet** — ready to print or show on your phone.

### **Triage Statement (Read Aloud)**

> “I’ve had 6 days of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but today my throat almost completely closed. I have stridor, trouble breathing in, and earlier I was confused for 15 minutes. I’m worried my airway is closing and I might not be getting enough oxygen.”
