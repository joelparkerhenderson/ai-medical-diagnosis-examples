# AI medical diagnosis example: Copilot Think Deeper

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real hospital.

This page shows an AI medical diagnosis example that uses Microsoft Copilot Think Deeper.

This symptom list is in my own words.

Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in, like the wind knocked out of me. 
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife.

Great, thanks for sharing your own phrasing
It’s really helpful that you’ve distilled your experience into a concise list. To make sure I’m giving you exactly what you need, would you like me to:

Refine this list into a structured summary you can hand directly to your doctor or the ER team?

Map these symptoms to possible causes or urgent red-flag categories?

Draft a set of focused questions you can ask your provider when you arrive?

Or is there another way you’d like to use this symptom list? Let me know what would be most useful right now.

- Can you refine this into a structured summary for my doctor?

- What are the possible causes for my symptoms?

- What questions should I ask my healthcare provider?

# Key Questions to Ask Your Healthcare Provider

Below is a structured list of focused questions you can use during your appointment. Feel free to pick and choose the ones most relevant to your concerns.

---

## 1. Diagnosis & Severity
- What is your leading diagnosis based on my symptom pattern and exam findings?  
- What other conditions (differential diagnoses) are you considering?  
- How serious is the near-instant throat closing and stridor I experienced today?  
- Could my confusion episode indicate low oxygen, an infection spreading to the brain, or another issue?

---

## 2. Tests & Procedures
- Which imaging studies will you order (e.g., chest X-ray, CT scan, neck soft-tissue film)?  
- What laboratory tests do you need (e.g., blood counts, inflammatory markers, cultures, arterial blood gas)?  
- Will you test me for common respiratory pathogens (COVID-19, influenza, RSV, bacterial pneumonia)?  
- Do I need any pulmonary function tests, bronchoscopy, or ENT evaluation to assess airway swelling?

---

## 3. Treatment Plan & Medications
- What immediate treatments will you provide to open my airway and ease breathing?  
- Will you prescribe antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids, or bronchodilators?  
- If I’m started on inhalers or nebulisers, how and when should I use them at home?  
- Should I carry an emergency inhaler, epinephrine auto-injector, or other rescue medication?

---

## 4. Monitoring & Follow-Up
- What vital sign thresholds or warning signs should prompt me to call emergency services again?  
- How often will you monitor my oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and temperature?  
- When and how will you reassess my progress (e.g., repeat chest imaging, lab tests)?  
- Will I need a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist or ENT specialist?

---

## 5. Home Care & Supportive Measures
- Given my total loss of appetite and sweats, how should I manage hydration and nutrition?  
- Are there breathing exercises, positioning tips, or physiotherapy techniques I can use?  
- What over-the-counter remedies (e.g., saline nasal sprays, throat lozenges) are safe and effective?  
- How can I minimize the risk of spreading infection to my family?

---

## 6. Prognosis & Recovery
- What recovery timeline should I expect for my cough, breathing, and energy levels?  
- What complications should I watch for in the days or weeks ahead?  
- When is it safe to return to work or resume normal activities?

Feel free to jot these down or print them out. Bringing a notebook or having a friend/family member with you can also help ensure you cover all your concerns. Good luck at your appointment—being prepared will help you get the answers and care you need.
