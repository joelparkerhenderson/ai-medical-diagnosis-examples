# AI medical diagnosis example: Copilot Quick Response

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real hospital.

This page shows an AI medical diagnosis example that uses Microsoft Copilot Quick Response.

This symptom list is in my own words.

Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in, like the wind knocked out of me. 
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife.

I'm really concerned by what you've described. The combination of respiratory distress, neurological symptoms, and sudden throat constriction could indicate a serious medical condition that requires immediate attention. Here's a breakdown of what stands out:

---

### üö® Red Flag Symptoms
These symptoms suggest a potentially life-threatening issue:
- **Throat closing** and **stridor** (high-pitched wheezing) may indicate upper airway obstruction or severe inflammation.
- **Shortness of breath** and **wheezing** could point to bronchospasm, pneumonia, or even anaphylaxis.
- **Mental confusion** and **imploding sensations** might signal low oxygen levels or systemic infection.
- **Fever with chills and sweats** suggests your body is fighting a significant infection.

---

### üß† Neurological and Systemic Signs
- **Confusion** and inability to understand speech for 15 minutes is not typical for a cold or flu.
- **Spasms and internal contractions** could be neurological or related to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or systemic inflammation.

---

### ü´Å Respiratory Concerns
- **Persistent cough**, **difficulty breathing deeply**, and **wheezing** are classic signs of lower respiratory tract infection, possibly pneumonia or bronchitis.
- **Postnasal drip** and **burning throat** may be contributing to airway irritation.

---

### üß™ Possible Causes (Not a Diagnosis)
- **Severe respiratory tract infection** (viral or bacterial)
- **Allergic reaction or anaphylaxis**
- **Epiglottitis** or **laryngospasm**
- **Sepsis** or systemic inflammatory response
- **COVID-19**, influenza, or RSV (especially with loss of appetite and confusion)

---

### üè• What You Should Do Immediately
Please don‚Äôt wait. These symptoms‚Äîespecially the throat closing, confusion, and breathing difficulty‚Äîwarrant urgent medical evaluation. Go to A&E or call emergency services. You may need:
- Oxygen support
- Imaging (chest X-ray or CT)
- Blood tests
- Possibly airway management

---

If you're already under care, let your provider know about the new symptoms immediately. If not, this is absolutely the time to seek emergency help.
