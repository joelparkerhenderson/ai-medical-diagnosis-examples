# AI medical diagnostics examples: Grok 4

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real hospital.

This page shows an AI medical diagnosis example that uses xAI Grok 4.

This symptom list is in my own words.

Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in, like the wind knocked out of me. 
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife.

I'm not a doctor, but your symptoms suggest a significant respiratory infection or possibly another underlying condition that has evolved over the past six days. The progression of symptoms, especially the severity of throat closing, shortness of breath, and mental confusion, warrants urgent medical attention. Here's a breakdown based on your description:

- **Nose and respiratory symptoms**: The gold-colored mucus, runny/blocked nose, postnasal drip, and semi-productive cough point toward an infection, potentially bacterial (e.g., sinusitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia) given the colored mucus and duration. The intermittent stridor and wheezing suggest airway inflammation or constriction, which could be associated with conditions like bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, or even something more serious like epiglottitis or anaphylaxis, especially with the throat-closing sensation.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, soaking sweats, and chills indicate your body is fighting an infection. The persistence of these for several days is concerning and could suggest a systemic issue like influenza, COVID-19, or another viral/bacterial infection.

- **Throat symptoms**: The burning sensation in the throat and back of the mouth, combined with the near-instant throat closing and difficulty breathing in, is alarming. These could indicate severe inflammation, swelling (e.g., angioedema), or an obstruction in the upper airway. The sensation of having the "wind knocked out" and throat closing today raises red flags for a potentially life-threatening condition like anaphylaxis, epiglottitis, or laryngeal edema.

- **Unusual symptoms**: The total loss of appetite, internal spasms, and mental confusion are particularly concerning. Mental confusion lasting 15 minutes could indicate hypoxia (low oxygen levels), a neurological effect of infection (e.g., encephalitis), or a systemic issue like sepsis or severe dehydration. The "imploding" spasms are harder to pinpoint but could relate to muscle cramps, gastrointestinal involvement, or neurological symptoms tied to the infection or systemic inflammation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Seek immediate medical care**: The throat-closing sensation, shortness of breath, wheezing, and mental confusion are emergency symptoms. These could indicate a rapidly progressing condition like anaphylaxis, epiglottitis, or severe respiratory compromise. Go to an emergency room or call emergency services (e.g., 911 in the U.S.) as soon as possible.

2. **Possible diagnoses to discuss with a doctor**:
   - **Respiratory infections**: Pneumonia, bronchitis, or severe sinusitis.
   - **Viral infections**: Influenza, COVID-19 (consider testing if not already done), or another respiratory virus.
   - **Upper airway issues**: Epiglottitis, laryngitis, or angioedema (especially with throat closing).
   - **Allergic or anaphylactic reaction**: The sudden throat closing could suggest an allergic response, though less likely given the six-day duration.
   - **Systemic infection**: Sepsis or another severe infection, given the fever, confusion, and systemic symptoms.

3. **Information to share with healthcare providers**:
   - Timeline of symptoms (you’ve done a great job noting changes over six days).
   - Details of the throat-closing episodes and mental confusion (duration, triggers, severity).
   - Any recent exposures (e.g., sick contacts, travel, allergens, new medications).
   - Any underlying conditions (e.g., asthma, allergies, immune disorders).

4. **Tests to expect**: Doctors may order a chest X-ray, CT scan (for airway or lung issues), blood tests (for infection or inflammation markers), oxygen saturation monitoring, or a throat swab (for strep, COVID-19, or other infections). If throat closing is severe, they may perform a laryngoscopy to check the airway.

### Why urgent attention is critical:
The combination of throat closing, shortness of breath, and mental confusion suggests a potential for rapid deterioration. Conditions like epiglottitis or anaphylaxis can progress quickly and impair breathing, while confusion could indicate inadequate oxygen delivery or a systemic issue like sepsis. Even if it’s a less severe infection, the duration and intensity of symptoms need medical evaluation to prevent complications.

If you’re unable to get to a doctor immediately, avoid lying flat (to help with breathing), stay hydrated if possible, and monitor for worsening symptoms like increased confusion, blue lips, or inability to speak. Please prioritize getting medical help as soon as you can. If you have more details (e.g., fever temperature, medications tried, or recent exposures), I can refine this further, but the priority is getting you to a healthcare provider.
