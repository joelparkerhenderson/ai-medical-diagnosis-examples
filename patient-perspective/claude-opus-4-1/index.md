# AI medical diagnosis example: Claude Opus 4.1

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real hospital.

This page shows an AI medical diagnosis example that uses Anthropic Claude Opus 4.1.

## AI input prompt

```text
This symptom list is in my own words.

Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in, like the wind knocked out of me. 
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife.

## AI output response

These symptoms, especially the combination of breathing difficulties, throat closing sensations, and mental confusion, warrant immediate medical attention. Here's why:

## **Seek Emergency Care Immediately**

The following symptoms are particularly concerning:
- **Throat closing sensation** - Could indicate significant airway swelling
- **Shortness of breath with stridor/wheezing** - Suggests airway obstruction
- **Mental confusion** - May indicate low oxygen levels or severe infection
- **"Wind knocked out" breathing sensation** - Concerning for respiratory distress

## Go to the Emergency Department NOW if you have:
- Difficulty breathing that's worsening
- Feeling like your throat is closing
- Confusion or difficulty staying alert
- Lips or face turning blue/gray
- Severe chest pain
- Unable to speak in full sentences

## This Could Be:
- **Severe respiratory infection** requiring immediate treatment
- **Epiglottitis** or other serious throat infection
- **Severe allergic reaction** (even without known triggers)
- **COVID-19, RSV, or influenza** with complications
- **Bacterial superinfection** on top of viral illness

## What to Do Right Now:

1. **Call 911/999** if breathing becomes severely difficult or throat closing worsens
2. **Go to the ER immediately** - don't wait for an appointment
3. **If driving, have someone else take you** - don't drive yourself
4. **Bring a list of all symptoms** and their timeline
5. **Wear a mask** to protect others

## Important Information for Medical Staff:
- Day 6 of illness with worsening respiratory symptoms
- Throat closing sensation (new today)
- Breathing difficulty for 5 days
- Mental confusion episode
- Stridor and wheezing present

**Do not delay seeking care.** These symptoms together suggest a potentially serious condition that needs immediate evaluation and treatment. The combination of upper and lower respiratory symptoms with throat closing and confusion is not typical of a simple cold or flu.
