# AI medical diagnosis example: Copilot Quick Response

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real hospital.

This page shows an AI medical diagnosis example that uses Microsoft Copilot Quick Response.

This symptom list is in my own words.

Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in, like the wind knocked out of me. 
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife.

Thanks for sharing such a detailed symptom profile ‚Äî it paints a vivid clinical picture. Based on your description and current SNOMED CT terminology, here‚Äôs a ranked list of probable diagnostic codes that could be considered in a clinical setting:

## üß† Top Probable SNOMED CT Diagnoses

| Rank | SNOMED CT Concept | Code | Rationale |
|------|--------------------|------|-----------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Acute viral upper respiratory tract infection** | 442696006 | Fits the progression from nasal symptoms to throat and lung involvement, with fever and systemic signs. |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **Acute bronchitis** | 10509002 | Persistent cough, mucus production, and wheezing suggest lower airway inflammation. |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup)** | 82271004 | Stridor, throat burning, and sudden airway closure are hallmark signs. |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Acute sinusitis** | 36971009 | Gold-colored mucus, postnasal drip, and nasal congestion are classic features. |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **Influenza-like illness** | 442438000 | Fever, chills, sweats, and systemic symptoms including confusion and appetite loss align with flu syndromes. |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | **Dyspnea** | 267036007 | Shortness of breath and difficulty inhaling are key respiratory distress indicators. |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | **Mental confusion** | 289908002 | Acute cognitive disturbance, even transient, is clinically significant. |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£ | **Anorexia (loss of appetite)** | 271327008 | Total loss of appetite is a notable systemic symptom. |
| 9Ô∏è‚É£ | **Wheezing** | 56018004 | Audible breath sounds and airway narrowing are consistent with this finding. |
| üîü | **Postnasal drip** | 64531003 | Described clearly in your nasal symptoms. |

## üß™ Additional Considerations

- **COVID-19** (SNOMED CT: 840539006) could be considered depending on exposure and testing, given the respiratory and systemic symptoms.
- **Epiglottitis** (SNOMED CT: 23924001) is rare but serious ‚Äî sudden throat closure and stridor warrant urgent evaluation.
- **Sepsis** (SNOMED CT: 91302008) is unlikely but possible if confusion and systemic collapse worsen.

If symptoms escalate or breathing becomes more difficult, urgent medical evaluation is essential. Would you like help finding a nearby urgent care or hospital?
