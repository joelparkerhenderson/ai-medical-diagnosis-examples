# AI medical diagnosis examples

AI is a powerful tool and many people worldwide are using it to help in many ways.

AI medical diagnosis is a complex discussion topic for many reasons.

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this
repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt
especially unwell.

I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real
hospital urgent care emergency department. The pages here demonstrate how
various AI system work with medical information by using an AI input prompt and
AI output response.

AI researchers are welcome to copy/paste my symptoms into their AI systems, to
discover what the AI outputs. If you do this, please send along your results to
me so I can add them to this repo.
