# AI medical diagnosis examples

**News: ChatGPT 5 is ready. The results are significant improvements over ChatGPT 4.**

AI is a powerful tool and many people worldwide are using it to help in many ways. 

AI medical diagnosis is a complex discussion topic for many reasons beyond the scope of this page.

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. 

I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor in a real hospital.

AI researchers are welcome to copy/paste my symptoms into their AI systems, to discover what the AI outputs. If you do this, please send along your results to me so I can add them to this repo.
