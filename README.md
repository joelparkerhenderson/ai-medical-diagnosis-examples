# AI medical diagnosis examples

AI is a powerful tool and many people worldwide are using it to help in many ways.

AI medical diagnosis is a complex discussion topic for many reasons.

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this
repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt
especially unwell.

I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor at a real
hospital urgent care emergency department. The pages here demonstrate how
various AI system work with medical information by using an AI input prompt and
AI output response.

AI researchers are welcome to copy/paste my symptoms into their AI systems, to
discover what the AI outputs. If you do this, please send along your results to
me so I can add them to this repo.

## AI prompt

```txt
This symptom list is in my own words.

Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in, like the wind knocked out of me.
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife.
```
