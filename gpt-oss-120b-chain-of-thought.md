# GPT-OSS 120B chain of thought

This page shows an AI medical diagnosis example that uses GPT-OSS 12B chain of thought. To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real doctor in a real hospital.

Input:

<pre>
... This symptom list is in my own words.
... 
... Sick for 6 days with significant changes in symptoms over days.
... 
... Nose:
... - Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
... - Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
... - Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.
... 
... Skin:
... - Fever.
... - Soaking sweats.
... - Shivering chills.
... 
... Lungs:
... - Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
... - Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
... - Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.
... 
... Throat:
... - My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
... - Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in because I had the wind knocked out of me. 
... - Today, near-instant throat closing.
... 
... Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
... - Total loss of appetite.
... - Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
..  . - Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife in casual conversation.

## Chain of thought

Thinking...

We need to answer as a medical professional? The user likely wants help diagnosing. We must be careful: we can provide general information but cannot give definitive diagnosis or 
medical advice. We can encourage seeking urgent care. The symptoms: severe respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing, throat burning, shortness of breath, cough, fever, sweats, 
confusion, appetite loss, internal spasms. This could be epiglottitis, croup, severe asthma exacerbation, or allergic reaction, or COVID-19, or bacterial pneumonia, or severe viral 
infection. The presence of stridor suggests upper airway obstruction. Could be laryngitis, epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis. The timeline: started with nose symptoms, then 
progressed. The presence of "gold-colored mucus" suggests maybe sinus infection. But then severe respiratory distress. The internal contraction spasms? Could be anaphylaxis. But also 
mental confusion. The suggestion: maybe it's a severe asthma attack or COPD? But not known. Also the mention of "wind knocked out of me" could be a severe respiratory event. They had 
throat closing sensation. Suggests laryngeal edema.

We should encourage emergency evaluation. Provide differential: epiglottitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, acute asthma exacerbation, allergic reaction, bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, 
etc. Ask about risk factors: age, immunization, allergies. Suggest immediate urgent care if breathing difficulty.

We can mention the importance of oxygen saturation, airway management. Provide immediate actions: keep calm, avoid lying flat, use epinephrine if allergic, get to ED.

We should provide information about common causes.

Let's propose: The most concerning is epiglottitis or acute laryngotracheobronchitis. The golden mucus could be sinusitis but not likely. The confusion could be due to hypoxia. The 
loss of appetite and abdominal cramps may be due to stress. The shortness of breath and wheeze may indicate severe asthma or allergic reaction.

We should say it's urgent.

We should note that the internal contraction spasms could be due to panic or anxiety.

We can give suggestions: keep airway open, try breathing exercises. But not definitive.

We should encourage seeing a doctor. No diagnosis. Provide guidelines.

We should also mention possible lab tests. Suggest imaging: chest X-ray. Provide general info.

We should keep safe. Use disclaimers.

...done thinking.

## Output

**What you’re describing is serious.**  
The combination of a sudden, tightening throat, stridor (a high‑pitched “whooshing” sound), shortness of breath, wheezing, fever, sweating, confusion, and a sense of the airway 
“closing in” is a classic red‑flag picture that should be evaluated by a clinician immediately—ideally in an emergency department or urgent‑care setting.

---

## 1.  What can cause this mix of symptoms?

| Possible cause | Key features that fit | Typical red‑flag sign |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Acute epiglottitis** (usually bacterial, often *Haemophilus influenzae* type b) | • Sudden onset, severe sore throat<br>• Stridor, “thumb‑in‑the‑neck” appearance, drooling<br>• 
Fever, chills, rapid breathing | Rapid airway obstruction; patient can’t lie flat; may have drooling or “hot‑fingers” |
| **Acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup)** | • “Whooping” cough, stridor, hoarse voice<br>• More common in kids, but adults can get it (often viral) | Classic “whoop” after 
coughing; bark‑like cough; drooling |
| **Severe asthma or COPD exacerbation** | • History of asthma/COPD<br>• Wheeze, shortness of breath, productive cough<br>• Possible hypoxia‑induced confusion | Rapidly worsening 
dyspnea, wheeze, use of accessory muscles |
| **Allergic anaphylaxis** | • Sudden throat swelling, tightness, wheeze<br>• Skin changes (rash, hives)<br>• Loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal cramps | Rapid onset, hypotension, 
urticaria |
| **Bacterial pneumonia** | • Fever, sweats, productive cough, shortness of breath<br>• Possible confusion from hypoxia | Chest pain, abnormal breath sounds |
| **COVID‑19 (or other viral pneumonia)** | • Fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of appetite<br>• Confusion if severe | Loss of smell, GI symptoms, hypoxia |
| **Other rare causes** | • Tracheitis, foreign‑body aspiration, airway tumors | Usually have a history or specific risk factors |

## 2.  What to do right now (if you haven’t already)

1. **Call emergency services (911 in the U.S.) or go to the nearest emergency department.**  
   *If you’re in the U.S.*—dial 911. *If you’re elsewhere*, use your local emergency number.

2. **Keep the airway open:**
   * Sit upright or sit forward (think “seated on the edge of a chair”) to ease breathing.
   * Avoid lying flat, because that can worsen airway obstruction.
   * If you have an inhaler (e.g., albuterol or rescue inhaler), use it now.

3. **If you suspect an allergic reaction** (e.g., swelling, hives, feeling of “tightness” that’s worse than your normal breathing), consider giving an epinephrine auto‑injector (if 
you have one) immediately—then seek emergency care.

4. **Stay calm and avoid panic**; anxiety can worsen shortness of breath.

5. **Try not to drink or eat** until you can see a clinician—especially if you’re having trouble swallowing or your throat feels “closed in.”

## 3.  What will a clinician do?

| Step | What it tells us |
|------|-----------------|
| **Physical exam** (inspection, auscultation, palpation of neck, check for drooling, look for cyanosis) | Confirms the presence of airway swelling or obstruction |
| **Oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry)** | Identifies hypoxia, a marker for urgent intervention |
| **Airway imaging** (neck X‑ray, CT if needed) | Visualizes epiglottitis, tracheal narrowing |
| **Chest X‑ray** | Looks for pneumonia, pulmonary edema |
| **Blood tests** (CBC, CRP, blood cultures) | Detects infection, rule out sepsis |
| **Allergy testing or serum tryptase** | If anaphylaxis is suspected |
| **Administer medications** (epinephrine, antibiotics, steroids, bronchodilators, oxygen) | Treats the underlying cause and stabilizes the airway |

---

## 4.  Why confusion and “internal contraction spasms” matter

- **Confusion** can be a sign of *hypoxia* (not enough oxygen reaching the brain) or *sepsis* (body’s inflammatory response to infection).
- **“Imploding” or inward‑pulling sensation** may be a manifestation of intense anxiety or a feeling of throat closure—often associated with epiglottitis, severe asthma, or 
anaphylaxis.
- Loss of appetite, sweating, and shivering are classic systemic responses to fever or infection, but also can accompany severe stress.

---

## 5.  Bottom line

Your symptoms are **consistent with an acute airway emergency**. Even if you feel better after a short while, the risk of sudden worsening is high. Immediate evaluation by emergency 
physicians is essential. Do **not** wait until the next day or try to manage it at home.

If you’re already in the hospital, be sure to let the medical team know about:

- The timeline (when symptoms started and how they progressed)
- Any allergies or medications you’re on
- The “gold‑colored mucus” (could hint at sinus infection or bacterial super‑infection)
- Any recent illnesses or exposures (travel, sick contacts, pets)

### Quick checklist for the emergency department

- **Vital signs**: BP, HR, RR, SpO₂, Temp
- **Airway**: Neck flexion, stridor, drooling
- **Breathing**: Breath sounds, use of accessory muscles
- **Circulation**: Skin color, capillary refill
- **Neuro**: Level of consciousness, confusion

---

**If you’re currently outside a hospital and can’t get help fast enough, try to get someone with an epinephrine auto‑injector to help or call your local emergency number.** The sooner 
the airway is secured, the better the outcome.
