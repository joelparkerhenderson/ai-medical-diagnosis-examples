Thanks for the detailed description—that helps a lot. Based on your symptoms, you’re dealing with something more serious than a common cold or mild respiratory infection. This constellation of symptoms suggests a severe respiratory infection, possibly viral pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, or even epiglottitis or laryngotracheobronchitis (croup-like illness) in adults—each of which can be dangerous. Here's a breakdown by system:

### Red Flags

- Shortness of breath + stridor + throat closing sensation → possible upper airway obstruction (like epiglottitis, anaphylaxis, or laryngeal involvement).

- Mental confusion + fever → possible sepsis, hypoxia, or encephalopathy.

- Internal contraction spasms → could be systemic reaction, electrolyte imbalance, or even CNS involvement.

### Working differential diagnosis

1. Viral pneumonia (COVID-19, influenza A/B, RSV, etc.)

   - Productive cough, fever, loss of appetite, SOB, fatigue.

   - Confusion suggests hypoxia or systemic infection.

2. Epiglottitis (can occur in adults)

   - Sore throat + painful swallowing + stridor + “air hunger” + high fever.

   - Rapid airway closure is an emergency.

3. COVID-19 (or post-viral complications)

   - Golden mucus suggests initial viral followed by bacterial superinfection.

   - Mental confusion and full-body effects are very possible.

   - You’d need a test to confirm or rule it out.

4. Sepsis or systemic inflammatory response

   - Fever, chills, sweating, confusion, low appetite, abnormal breathing.

   - Can stem from pneumonia or upper respiratory infection.

5. Severe influenza or RSV

   - Can cause all your symptoms including neuroinvolvement, GI symptoms, airway swelling.

6. Anaphylaxis or angioedema

   - If the throat is closing suddenly and there's wheezing/stridor—it might be an allergic reaction, though less likely if it’s been days in progress.

### What you should do right now

This is a situation that requires immediate medical attention. 

Especially because:

- You are having difficulty breathing and possibly losing your airway.

- You have neurological symptoms (confusion).

- You have systemic signs (sweating, fever, spasms).

Even if it's "just viral," some viruses can be deadly when they affect multiple systems.

### Show this to your doctor

PATIENT SYMPTOM SUMMARY – URGENT

Onset: 4–5 days ago  
Primary concerns: Difficulty breathing, mental confusion, systemic symptoms

RESPIRATORY:
- Shortness of breath (5 days) – difficulty inhaling deeply
- Frequent, semi-productive cough
- Intermittent wheezing, stridor, whistling breath sounds
- Sudden “throat closing” sensation (today)
- Sensation of “wind knocked out of me” (yesterday)

NASAL:
- Gold-colored mucus at start
- Runny then blocked nose with postnasal drip (4 days)
- Constant nose blowing

THROAT:
- Burning sensation in upper throat/back of mouth
- Increasing difficulty breathing through throat

SYSTEMIC:
- Fever, chills, soaking sweats
- Sudden total loss of appetite
- Involuntary internal spasms (“imploding” feeling)
- Mental confusion – unable to understand work or simple conversations

Concerns to evaluate:
- Viral or bacterial pneumonia
- Epiglottitis or upper airway obstruction
- Influenza, RSV, or COVID-19
- Sepsis or systemic inflammatory response
- Possible hypoxia or encephalopathy

Recommendation: Immediate medical evaluation required—possible airway emergency and systemic infection.
