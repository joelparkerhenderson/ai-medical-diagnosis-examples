# AI medical diagnosis example: ChatGPT 5

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this
repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt
especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real
doctor at a real hospital urgent care emergency department. This page shows the
AI input prompt and AI output response.

## AI input prompt

```text
You are an expert medical doctor.

You are training a junior doctor how to triage patients, how to diagnose
patients, and how to interact with patients.

Explain what a doctor should do when a patient comes into the hospital urgent
care emergency department.

The patient presents a list of symptoms.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in because I had the wind knocked out of me.
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife in casual conversation.

## AI output response

Alright — this is a *red flag* presentation.
If I were teaching a junior doctor, here’s how I’d walk through this case step-by-step in the emergency department.

---

## **1. Triage — Immediate Priorities**

When a patient presents with:

* **Acute shortness of breath**
* **Intermittent stridor** and **throat closing sensation**
* **Altered mental status** (even transient)
* **Fever, chills, and sweats**
  …this is **potentially life-threatening**.

**Triage priority:** **Category 1 or 2 (emergency)** — see immediately.

---

## **2. Initial Approach — ABCDE**

We always start with the **ABCDE** primary survey.

**A — Airway**

* Stridor + throat closing = possible **upper airway obstruction** (epiglottitis, anaphylaxis, severe laryngeal inflammation, abscess, or inhalation injury).
* Have airway equipment ready (bag-valve mask, laryngoscope, endotracheal tube, surgical airway backup).
* Call anaesthetics/ENT early.

**B — Breathing**

* Shortness of breath for 5 days, wheeze, whistling, plus cough.
* Check **SpO₂** immediately.
* Listen for **air entry** — absent/diminished sounds can mean obstruction, consolidation, or severe bronchospasm.
* Consider high-flow oxygen, but **do not agitate the patient** if upper airway swelling is suspected.

**C — Circulation**

* Fever + sweats + confusion suggests possible **sepsis**.
* Check heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill.
* Insert large-bore IV access ×2, draw bloods (CBC, CRP, U\&E, cultures, lactate).
* Start fluids if hypotensive.

**D — Disability**

* Mental confusion episode = possible hypoxia, hypercapnia, sepsis, or CNS involvement.
* Check GCS, capillary glucose, pupil response.

**E — Exposure**

* Look for rashes (meningococcal), swelling, cyanosis, dehydration signs.

---

## **3. Immediate Differential Diagnosis**

Based on the symptoms:

* **Severe bacterial infection of upper airway** (epiglottitis, supraglottitis) — burning throat, stridor, rapid onset airway compromise.
* **Pneumonia** (possibly bacterial) — cough, sputum, fever, chills, shortness of breath.
* **Sepsis** — fever, confusion, chills, rigors, possible low BP.
* **Anaphylaxis** — throat closing, wheeze, stridor (though here, timing is less classic; still must be ready).
* **Deep neck space infection** (peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess).
* **Influenza with secondary bacterial pneumonia** — gold mucus early, now worsening.

---

## **4. Initial Investigations (while stabilising)**

Only if the patient is stable after airway and breathing are secured:

* **O₂ saturation and ABG** (check hypoxia, CO₂ retention).
* **Portable chest X-ray** — pneumonia vs. other lung pathology.
* **CBC, CRP/ESR, blood cultures** — infection markers.
* **Electrolytes, renal function, lactate** — sepsis severity.
* **ECG** — tachycardia, arrhythmia from hypoxia/sepsis.

If airway swelling suspected — **no throat swab** (risk of airway closure).
Consider **nasopharyngoscopy** by ENT in controlled environment.

---

## **5. Treatment Priorities**

* **Airway support** — be ready for intubation; call anaesthetics/ENT early.
* **Oxygen** — aim SpO₂ >94% unless CO₂ retention.
* **Empiric IV antibiotics** — broad coverage for pneumonia + possible epiglottitis (e.g., ceftriaxone + vancomycin; local protocol applies).
* **IV fluids** — for hypotension/sepsis.
* **Steroids** — dexamethasone if airway inflammation suspected.
* **Nebulised adrenaline** — if upper airway obstruction suspected and patient deteriorating.
* **Continuous monitoring** — O₂ sat, heart rate, BP.

---

## **6. Communication & Patient Interaction**

For the junior doctor:

* Speak calmly, avoid unnecessary questions that distress the patient — airway compromise can worsen with agitation.
* Reassure the patient but be transparent about urgency (“We’re working quickly to help your breathing”).
* Keep the patient upright if that eases breathing — do not force them to lie down.

---

## **7. Red Flag Teaching Point**

When a patient presents with:

* Stridor
* Throat closing sensation
* Fever/chills
* Altered mental status

**Assume airway obstruction until proven otherwise**.
Do **not** send them to the waiting room. Do **not** leave them unattended.

---

If you want, I can walk you through **exactly how to distinguish epiglottitis from pneumonia in the first 5 minutes**, because this case has features of both — but airway danger takes priority over lung infection in triage.
