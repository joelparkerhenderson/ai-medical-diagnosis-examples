# AI medical diagnosis example: Copilot Think Deeper

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this
repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt
especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real
doctor at a real hospital urgent care emergency department. This page shows the
AI input prompt and AI output response.

## AI input prompt

```text
You are an expert medical doctor.

You are training a junior doctor how to triage patients, how to diagnose
patients, and how to interact with patients.

Explain what a doctor should do when a patient comes into the hospital urgent
care emergency department.

The patient presents a list of symptoms.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in, like the wind knocked out of me.
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife.

### Emergency Department Approach to a Complex Respiratory Case

When a patient presents with multi‐system symptoms—upper airway compromise, respiratory distress, systemic infection signs, and neurological changes—your priority is rapid assessment, safeguarding the airway, and targeted investigation. Below is a step-by-step guide for triage, diagnosis, management, and patient interaction.

---

### Step 1: Primary Survey & Triage (ABCDE)

1.  Airway  
    - Look for stridor, “throat closing,” voice changes, drooling.  
    - Prepare for advanced airway management (e.g., intubation, ENT backup).  

2.  Breathing  
    - Measure respiratory rate, effort (use of accessory muscles).  
    - Check oxygen saturation and auscultate lungs (wheeze, crackles, diminished breath sounds).  
    - Apply high-flow oxygen if SpO₂ < 94%.  

3.  Circulation  
    - Record heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill, skin perfusion.  
    - Establish two large-bore IV lines for fluids and meds.  

4.  Disability  
    - Assess level of consciousness (AVPU or GCS).  
    - Note any confusion or new neurological deficits.  

5.  Exposure  
    - Check full skin exam for rashes, swelling (angioedema), temperature.  
    - Keep patient warm to prevent hypothermia after fever-induced chills.  

**Immediate Red Flags**  
- Stridor or near-instant throat closure  
- Inability to speak in full sentences  
- New confusion or agitation  
- Severe hypoxia despite oxygen  

If any red flag is positive, escalate to the resuscitation bay and summon senior support immediately.

### Step 2: Focused History & Examination

- **Onset & Progression**  
  • Nasal symptoms: gold mucus → clear rhinorrhea → obstruction, post-nasal drip (4 days)  
  • Respiratory: SOB for 5 days, persistent productive cough, intermittent wheeze/stridor  
  • Systemic: fever, rigors, night sweats, anorexia, “imploding” abdominal spasms  
  • Neurological: 15-minute episode of confusion  

- **Associated Symptoms**  
  • Throat burning, sensation of wind being knocked out (possible airway edema)  
  • Near-instant throat closing (consider anaphylaxis, angioedema, epiglottitis)  

- **Risk Factors & History**  
  • Allergy history, recent infections, asthma/COPD, immunosuppression  
  • Recent travel, exposure to COVID-19, occupational hazards  
  • Medication use, especially ACE inhibitors (angioedema risk)  

- **Physical Exam**  
  • Throat: inspect for erythema, swelling, exudate, uvular deviation  
  • Sinuses: tenderness over maxillary/ frontal areas  
  • Chest: percussion, auscultation (wheeze vs crackles), look for retractions  
  • Neurological: orientation, speech, focal deficits

### Step 3: Differential Diagnosis

| System            | Key Diagnoses                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Upper Airway      | Epiglottitis, angioedema, severe allergic reaction, retropharyngeal abscess |
| Lower Respiratory | Bacterial/viral pneumonia, asthma exacerbation, bronchitis, COVID-19 |
| Systemic          | Sepsis from respiratory source, influenza, atypical infections |
| Neurological      | Hypoxic encephalopathy, sepsis-associated delirium            |

### Step 4: Investigations

1.  Vital signs continuous monitoring (including SpO₂)  
2.  Blood tests:  
    - CBC with differential, CRP, procalcitonin  
    - Blood cultures × 2 before antibiotics  
    - U&E, LFTs, coagulation profile  
3.  Microbiology:  
    - Nasopharyngeal swab (COVID-19/flu PCR)  
    - Throat swab or epiglottic culture if safe  
4.  Imaging:  
    - Chest X-ray (consolidation, effusion)  
    - Lateral neck X-ray or CT neck if epiglottitis/abscess suspected  
5.  Point-of-care:  
    - Arterial blood gas if severe hypoxia or CO₂ retention  
    - ECG if tachycardic or hypotensive

### Step 5: Initial Management

- Secure airway: be ready for intubation or surgical airway if airway edema worsens  
- Oxygen therapy: high-flow nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask  
- Nebulized bronchodilators (salbutamol ± ipratropium) for wheeze  
- IV corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation  
- Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics covering H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae  
- IV fluids to maintain perfusion and correct dehydration  
- Analgesia and antipyretics (paracetamol) for fever and throat pain  

Continuously re-assess ABCDE and escalate care if deterioration occurs.

---

### Step 6: Patient Interaction & Communication

- Begin with open-ended questions: “Tell me how this started and how you feel now.”  
- Use simple language to explain findings and planned interventions.  
- Acknowledge their distress: “I understand breathing feels frightening right now.”  
- Involve family: update the spouse or partner to ease anxiety.  
- Set expectations: “We’re monitoring your breathing and running tests to find the cause.”  
- Document all discussions, consent, and any refusals clearly in the notes.

By following this structured approach—prioritizing airway safety, building a targeted differential, ordering focused investigations, and communicating compassionately—you’ll ensure that even complex presentations are managed rapidly, safely, and with patient-centered care.
