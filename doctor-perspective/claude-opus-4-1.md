# AI medical diagnosis example: Claude Opus 4.1

To help make progress with conversations about AI medical diagnosis, this
repository contains my own writeup of my own real medical symptoms when I felt
especially unwell. I did the writeup at the start of my real visit to a real
doctor at a real hospital urgent care emergency department. This page shows the
AI input prompt and AI output response.

## AI input prompt

```text
You are an expert medical doctor.

You are training a junior doctor how to triage patients, how to diagnose
patients, and how to interact with patients.

Explain what a doctor should do when a patient comes into the hospital urgent
care emergency department.

The patient presents a list of symptoms.

Nose:
- Gold-color mucus at start of illness.
- Runny nose then blocked nose, with lots of postnasal drip, 4 days.
- Blowing nose every few minutes, 4 days.

Skin:
- Fever.
- Soaking sweats.
- Shivering chills.

Lungs:
- Shortness of breath for 5 days; hard to breathe in, hard to breathe deep.
- Pervasive semi-productive cough, every few minutes or so.
- Intermittent stridor, wheezing, whistling breath.

Throat:
- My upper throat and back of my mouth feels like it's burning.
- Yesterday, a sensation that I couldn't breathe in because I had the wind knocked out of me.
- Today, near-instant throat closing.

Strange issues that are wholly different than any of my previous illnesses:
- Total loss of appetite.
- Spasms of internal contractions, like an imploding feeling, pulling inwards.
- Mental confusion for 15 minutes, bad enough that I couldn't understand my wife in casual conversation.

As an experienced emergency physician training a junior doctor, let me walk you through how to approach this patient presenting to the ED with these concerning symptoms.

## Initial Triage and Assessment

**Immediate Priority:** This patient requires urgent evaluation. The combination of respiratory distress, potential airway involvement (throat closing sensation), and systemic symptoms warrants immediate attention.

**Primary Concerns to Address:**
- Airway compromise (throat closing, stridor)
- Breathing difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing)
- Systemic infection signs (fever, sweats, chills)
- Altered mental status episode

## Systematic Approach

### 1. Primary Survey (ABCs)
**Airway:** Assess immediately. The "throat closing" sensation and stridor are red flags for potential upper airway obstruction. Look for:
- Voice changes
- Difficulty swallowing
- Visible pharyngeal swelling
- Position of comfort (tripoding suggests severe distress)

**Breathing:** Evaluate work of breathing:
- Respiratory rate and pattern
- Oxygen saturation
- Use of accessory muscles
- Auscultate for wheezing, stridor location (inspiratory suggests upper airway, expiratory suggests lower)

**Circulation:** Check vital signs comprehensively:
- Blood pressure for signs of sepsis or anaphylaxis
- Heart rate
- Temperature (document fever)

### 2. Focused History (While Stabilizing)

Ask targeted questions:
- **Onset and progression:** How quickly did symptoms develop? Any rapid deterioration?
- **Allergies/exposures:** New medications, foods, environmental exposures?
- **Medical history:** Asthma, COPD, cardiac disease, immunosuppression?
- **Recent travel or sick contacts**
- **Vaccination status** (including COVID-19, influenza)

### 3. Physical Examination Focus Areas

**ENT Examination:**
- Inspect oropharynx for erythema, exudate, uvular deviation
- Palpate neck for lymphadenopathy, thyroid enlargement
- Look for signs of peritonsillar abscess or epiglottitis

**Respiratory Examination:**
- Full lung auscultation
- Assess for signs of pneumonia, bronchospasm
- Note any asymmetry suggesting pneumothorax or effusion

**Neurological Quick Screen:**
- Given the confusion episode, check orientation and basic neurological function
- Consider meningeal signs if fever present

### 4. Differential Diagnosis to Consider

**Most Concerning (Rule Out First):**
- Epiglottitis or supraglottitis
- Peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess
- Anaphylaxis (even without classic urticaria)
- Bacterial pneumonia with sepsis
- COVID-19 with respiratory compromise

**Also Consider:**
- Severe viral upper respiratory infection with secondary bacterial infection
- Influenza with complications
- Acute bronchitis progressing to pneumonia
- Atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma, Legionella)

### 5. Initial Management Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Place on continuous monitoring
2. Establish IV access
3. Administer supplemental oxygen if SpO2 <94%
4. Have airway equipment readily available

**Diagnostic Workup:**
- CBC with differential
- Basic metabolic panel
- Inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin)
- Blood cultures if febrile
- Chest X-ray
- Consider CT neck if concerned about deep space infection
- Respiratory pathogen panel (including COVID-19, influenza)
- Consider ABG if significant respiratory distress

**Treatment Considerations:**
- If any concern for anaphylaxis: epinephrine immediately
- If bacterial infection suspected: broad-spectrum antibiotics after cultures
- Bronchodilators for wheezing
- Corticosteroids if significant airway edema or severe bronchospasm
- Antipyretics for fever

### 6. Key Teaching Points for Junior Doctors

**Critical Decision Points:**
1. **Airway protection is paramount** - If there's any doubt about airway stability, involve anesthesia/ENT early
2. **Don't dismiss subjective symptoms** - "Throat closing" sensations can precede actual obstruction
3. **Think beyond common diagnoses** - The unusual symptoms (internal spasms, confusion) suggest this isn't a typical URI
4. **Maintain high index of suspicion** - Multiple systems involved often indicates serious pathology

**Documentation Essentials:**
- Time course of symptoms
- Vital sign trends
- Response to interventions
- Clear reasoning for disposition decision

### 7. Disposition Planning

This patient likely requires:
- **Minimum:** Extended ED observation with serial examinations
- **Probable:** Hospital admission for monitoring and treatment
- **Consider ICU** if: worsening respiratory status, need for airway intervention, hemodynamic instability

**Consultation Considerations:**
- ENT if upper airway pathology suspected
- Infectious Disease for atypical presentation
- Critical Care if deteriorating

Remember: When a patient presents with multiple concerning symptoms affecting multiple systems, maintain a broad differential while aggressively ruling out life-threatening conditions. The combination of respiratory, neurological, and constitutional symptoms demands thorough evaluation and likely admission for close monitoring and treatment.
